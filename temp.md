❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` relies on global variables `a` and `b` without declaring them or passing them as arguments. This
makes the function's behavior unpredictable and dependent on the global scope.
* ❌ Missing input validation: There are no checks to ensure that `a` and `b` are numbers. If they are not numbers, the
`+` operator might perform string concatenation instead of addition, leading to unexpected results.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return 'Error: Both arguments must be numbers.';
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now takes `a` and `b` as parameters, making it self-contained and predictable.
* ✔ Added input validation to check if both `a` and `b` are numbers. If not, it returns an error message.
* ✔ Improved readability with proper spacing and a clear return statement.
